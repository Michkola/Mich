        <!-- First, we start with a division with a tag called div. 
            To understand the concept of a division (div tag) on html, 
        please draw a rectangle on a plain sheet using a pencil. then divide the rectangle into 3 vertically
    now erase the first vertical divide to make the left side wider than the two part.
     This is same thing as making a div on HTML as you can specify 
     the size of your div and even display a table-like content with it.
    
    Notice the class attribute on our div tags? 
    This attribute specifies the CSS class that contains the instruction on how to redender this div. 
    We will look at this later in the CSS part of the project
